Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        one = 0
        while n > 0:
            one += 1 & n
            n = n >> 1
        
        return one
        
        
        
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        one = 0
        while n > 0:
            one += n % 2
            n = n // 2
            
        return one
