Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. 
The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

class Solution:
    # @param A  a list of integers
    # @param m  an integer, length of A
    # @param B  a list of integers
    # @param n  an integer, length of B
    # @return nothing
    def merge(self, A, m, B, n):
        # do it reversely, from largest to smallest
        for i in range(n):
            A.append(0)
            
        a = m - 1
        b = n - 1
        k = m + n - 1
        while a >= 0 and b >=0:
            if A[a] >= B[b]:
                A[k] = A[a]
                a -= 1
                k -= 1
            else:
                A[k] = B[b]
                b -= 1
                k -= 1
        
        if a == -1 and k >= 0:
            for i in range(k+1):
                A[i] = B[i]
