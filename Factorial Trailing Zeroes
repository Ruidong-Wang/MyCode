Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

class Solution:
    # @return an integer
    
    # just count number of factor 5's
    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        zeros = 0
        quotient = n
        while quotient >= 5:
            zeros = zeros + quotient // 5
            quotient = quotient // 5
        return zeros
