Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

class Solution:
    # @return a string
    # strs is a list containing strings
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if strs == []:
            return ""
        
        common = ""
        for i in range(len(strs[0])):
            for j in range(len(strs)):
                if i >= len(strs[j]):        #string j is short
                    return common
                else:
                    if strs[0][i] != strs[j][i]:         #the ith char is not match
                        return common
            common = common + strs[0][i]
        
        return common
