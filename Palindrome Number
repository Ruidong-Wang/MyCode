Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.


Some hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.



class Solution:
    # @return a boolean
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        import math
        
        if x < 0:
            return False
        if x == 0:
            return True
            
        maxpower = int(math.log(x,10))
        # two pointer left and right
        left = 10** maxpower
        right = 1
        
        while left > right:
            if (x // left) % 10 == (x // right) % 10:
                left = left / 10
                right = right * 10
            else:
                return False
                
        return True
